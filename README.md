e to e testing like to make your self as a normal user and make interact with the page
Unit testing like you are testing a function or a method
Integration testing like to test your components work together or not

JS Framework
1\_ Jest :
Code Coverage => show the percentage of coverage
Mocking => separating your code from related dependencies during testing
Snapshot testing => verify that there are no regression in the DOM

TDD => Test Driven Development

step one => check if the function exist (failed) ğŸ”´ RED
step tow => declare the function (passed) ğŸŸ¢ GREEN
step three => check if the function exist (passed) âœ… REFACTOR

to install jest => npm init -y

Pipes :
use pipes to combine commands together. Example: ls file1.txt | wc-w  
think of it like i pass the ls command as input the the wc command
Grep => global regular expression print
ex:
grep ou test1.txt => grep all the content contain ou in there
grep -i ou test1.txt => grep all the content contain ou in the start meddle and final

git checkout main => to change to the main branch
feature => name given to the default remote repository
lesson => the name of a branch in the Git repository
